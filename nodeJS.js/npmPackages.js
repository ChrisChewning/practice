NODE PACKAGE MANAGER (npm)
the 'largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.'

NPM INIT
Creates package.json. ... The default name for this file is index.js unless you created server.js or something else.js in not in a folder.

PACKAGE.JSON
All npm packages contain a file, usually in the project root, called package.json - this file holds various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the projects dependencies. It can also contain other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information, even configuration data - all of which can be vital to both npm and to the end users of the package. The package.json file is normally located at the root directory of a Node.js project.

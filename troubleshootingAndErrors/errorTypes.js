Tokens: These are words or symbols used by code to specify the logic of the application. These include things like +, -, ?, if, else, and var. These are reserved by the JavaScript engine, and thus cannot be used incorrectly, or as part of variable names and the like.


Control characters: A subset of tokens which are used to direct the “flow” of the code into code blocks. These are typically used to maintain scope, with braces ({ ... }) and the like.

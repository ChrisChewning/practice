1. What is a class?

class = Classes are in fact "special functions." Is hoisted. Classes take a capital letter. You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a ReferenceError:

const p = new Rectangle(); // ReferenceError

class Rectangle {}



2. prototype = All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.

The prototype property allows you to add new properties and methods to existing object types.

Note: Prototype is a global property which is available with almost all JavaScript objects.

4. difference between undefined and not defined =
In JavaScript if you try to use a variable that doesn't exist and has not been declared, then JavaScript will throw an error "var name is not defined" and the script will stop execute thereafter.


A variable can be declared but not defined. This is undefined.
var x; // Declaration
typeof x === 'undefined'; // Will return true

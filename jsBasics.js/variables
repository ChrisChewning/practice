1. initialize a variable
var greeting;  
cannot say const greeting though. Error: missing initializer in const declaration.

2. you can reassign let and var but not const. 

3. you can create private variables using the _ sign. 

4. Variables can only have numbers, letters, _, and $. Cannot start with a number

5. Conventions
*js uses camelCase primarily but remember PHP and other would be camel_case
*Pascal case is when each word starts with a capital letter.

6. Object literal:

 const person = {
    name: 'chris',
    age: 32
}

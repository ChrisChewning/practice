1. npm init
2. npm install react react-dom (this goes in your lock.json file)
3. npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015 (year right?)
4. npm install webpack webpack-dev-server

5. create a webpack.config.js file.
- in your webpack.config.js you will require path var path = require('path'). This gives us the path module provided by nodejs. This allows us to get the current directory and other things.

- in your webpack.config.js file you will put your module.exports). this exports all of the settings for webpack.

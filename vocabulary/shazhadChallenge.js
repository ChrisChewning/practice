Why accessibility is important?


Difference between semantics and syntax? Syntax is the structure of the language. Semantics is your codes meaning.


JAVASCRIPT

variables - (const and let and var): const doesn't change, while let does. var will just go ahead and declare the variable, which can cause a lot of bugs, because you might accidentally use the same variable twice.

FUNCTIONS: WHY THE ARROW FUNCTION
1. shorter syntax
2. no binding of the keyword 'this'
//function rules
1. name contains a verb b.c they do something
2. they get or set (assign a value) data.
3. check data
4. print data


ex1: var feedTheCat = (cat) => {
  if (cat === 'hungry') {
    return 'Feed the cat';
  } else {
    return 'Do not feed the cat';
  }
}

ex2: var addValues = (x, y) => {
  return x + y
}


ARROW FUNCTIONS: WHEN NOT TO USE

1. Object Methods
var cat = {
  lives: 9,
  jumps: () => {
    this.lives--;
  }
}

2. Callbacks
var button = document.getElementById('press');
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  this.classList.toggle('on');
});



CONSOLE LOG()
A debugger, or 'sandbox' to test your code.


DATA TYPES
1. Boolean = true/false.
2. Null = a variable that is defined to have a null value.

ex: var nullVariable = null; // null
typeof nullVariable // "object"

3. Undefined = isnt defined.
4. Number = number
5. String = "" ()
6. Symbol = ?? lets you add private-ish properties to data?
7. Object = everything in javascript.


JAVASCRIPT EDITIONS
ES 5, 6, 7, 8 are all javascript editions. (es5: 2009; es8: 2017)



NUMBERS & OPERATORS
operators: + - * / % (modulus) ++ -- (++ or -- could also +2 -3 etc.)

ASSIGNMENT operators
= (assign)
+= (addition assignment operator adds a value to a variable)
-=
*=
/=
%=
note: + or += can be used to concatentate.


COMPARISON OPERATORS
==	equal to
===	equal value and equal type
!=	not equal
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>	greater than
<	less than
>=	greater than or equal to
<=	less than or equal to
?	ternary operator (usually used as a shortcut for if statements)

ternary ex: var func1 = function( .. ) {
  if (condition1) { return value1 }
  else { return value2 }
}

var func2 = function( .. ) {
  return condition1 ? value1 : value2
}


LOGICAL OPERATORS
&&	logical and
||	logical or
!	logical not


TYPE OPERATORS
typeof	Returns the type of a variable
instanceof	Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type




            - anonymous vs named functions and variables
            - stack trace
            - truthy/falsy
            - for loop & for each
            - nested loops
            - array methods
            - object methods
            - string methods (all on MDN)
            - scope
            - conditionals (if else)
            - Events

            - this (https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-keyword-this-for-beginners-fb5238d99f85)
            - return
            - DOM Manipulation
            - Higher order functions (map, filter, reduce etc..)
            - constructors v classes
            - prototype chain
            - algorithms
            - Third Party Libraries and Frame works
                - jQuery
                - bootstrap
                - materialize

Async & Await (a better way to do promises)
* asynch is a function. This is for asynchronous functions when one function awaits another one. Async can be used without await. "When you create a function with the async keyword that function will always return a Promise. When you return inside your async function it wraps your value in a Promise."

* await is a keyword that can only be used inside await.
Await lets you pause the execution of an async function until it receives the results of a promise. This lets you write async code that reads in the order that itâ€™s executed.

*Await allows you to write asynchronous code with no callbacks at all. This makes your code much more readable. And await works with any promise, not just promises created by async functions.

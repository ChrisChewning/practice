Why accessibility is important?


Difference between semantics and syntax? Syntax is the structure of the language. Semantics is your codes meaning.


JAVASCRIPT

variables - (const and let and var): const doesn't change, while let does. var will just go ahead and declare the variable, which can cause a lot of bugs, because you might accidentally use the same variable twice.


functions - why the arrow function?
1. shorter syntax
2. no binding of the keyword 'this'
//function rules
1. name contains a verb b.c they do something
2. they get or set (assign a value) data.
3. check data
4. print data


ex1: var feedTheCat = (cat) => {
  if (cat === 'hungry') {
    return 'Feed the cat';
  } else {
    return 'Do not feed the cat';
  }
}

ex2: var addValues = (x, y) => {
  return x + y
}


console.log() - A debugger, or 'sandbox' to test your code.

data types =
Boolean = true/false
Null = a variable that is defined to have a null value.

ex: var nullVariable = null; // null
typeof nullVariable // "object"

Undefined = isnt defined.
Number = number
String = "" ()
Symbol = ?? lets you add private-ish properties to data?
Object = everything in javascript.

            - anonymous vs named functions and variables
            - stack trace
            - truthy/falsy
            - for loop & for each
            - nested loops
            - array methods
            - object methods
            - string methods (all on MDN)

            - conditionals (if else)
            - Events
            - this
            - return
            - DOM Manipulation
            - Higher order functions (map, filter, reduce etc..)
            - constructors v classes
            - prototype chain
            - algorithms
            - Third Party Libraries and Frame works
                - jQuery

<strong> and <em>
Personally I use <em> for normal emphasis where youd read the emphasised word in a different tone of voice, and <strong> for that thing where you take key words and phrases to pick them out of the text to help people skimming the text pick out the subjects.

In HTML or JS or your schema in mongoDB, you can require things like minlength, you can trim out white space, require characters besides just letters, etc. Below are some common types:

- disabled:	Specifies that the input element should be disabled
